* segmented unit tests: for when your unit tests want to depend on other code 
  you've written to avoid writing grotty constructors and constructor-like 
  code. You insert boundaries, and the unit test system tells you which side
  changed (thus, who to blame). Try a few variations on this.
* hey, if we're letting our tooling look into the version history,
  something with the backwards-compatibility properties of protocol buffers
  should be automatically derivable from type definitions. Okay, this probably
  takes way too much guessing for something whose semantics can be permanently
  affected by past commits.
* a tool for quickly expanding templates over cross-products of lists of syntax,
  for avoiding small-scale repetition.
* a tool to automatically turn on logging and `diff` log messages from the
  failing tests in current version of the repo against the last good run.

If you want to contribute...

 * You can write code in Unseemly! It needs testing! You can add examples to `src/examples`, and
   file bugs in the [issue  tracker] when things don't work
 * You fix a bug. There are some in the [issue tracker]. Issues that don't require much
   context about the language and are on the smaller side are marked ["good first issue"].
 * You can fix a TODO. There are [a lot of TODOs] in the codebase. Some of them are simple
   refactorings, some are self-contained design issues, others are more complex.
 * You can file a bug. If you find a problem or want a feature, the [issue tracker] the place to
   go. Many of the TODOs should be given associated issues (i.e. `// TODO #7832`).
